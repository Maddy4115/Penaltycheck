# Penaltycheck
Problem statement for Football data:
1st Semi-final match of EPL is between Arsenal vs Liverpool. Let's assume the scores are leveled at 1-1 at th end of allotted 90 minutes. Even the extra half an hour could not conclude the match with the scoreboard still reading 1-1. This led the match towards penalty shoot-outs to break the tie. 
After the Liverpool player scored the goal in the peultimate penalty kick, Liverpool are 3-2 ahead in the penalty shotouts.
Arsenal still has a penalty kick left and the opportuanity to extend the tie further but if misses Arsenal's campaign will be over in the competition.
What shoul Arsenal do to extend the tie?
